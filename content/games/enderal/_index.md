[Enderal: Forgotten Stories](https://sureai.net/games/enderal/) (abbreviated to **Enderal**) is a single-player fantasy RPG created by the German game studio [SureAI](https://sureai.net). The base game was released in 2016 under the name "Enderal: The Shards of Order" (German: "Enderal: Die Trümmer der Ordnung"), and the DLC "Enderal: Forgotten Stories" followed in 2019. The game is set in its own universe, using [Skyrim](/games/skyrim)'s engine.

**Note**: This is the original 32-Bit version of the game, and I would recommend that you opt for the 64-Bit version [Enderal SE](/games/enderal-se) instead, as it is more stable and suitable for modern day hardware.

**Note**: To any German native speakers, **I highly recommend to play the game in German**. It is a master class in character and dialogue writing, and the voice actors are incredible. (I am sure that the English version is excellent as well, but I have only played the German one, since I am a German native speaker myself.)

## About Enderal 

**(From [SureAI's Official Website](https://sureai.net/games/enderal/))**

Enderal is a total conversion for TES V: Skyrim: a game modification that is set in its own world with its own landscape, lore and story. It offers an immersive open world, all for the player to explore, overhauled skill systems and gameplay mechanics and a dark, psychological storyline with believable characters.

Enderal is free and can be played by anyone owning a legal copy of TES V: Skyrim. (No DLCs are necessary.) It is developed non-commercially by SureAI, the team behind the renowned Oblivion mod "Nehrim: At Fate's Edge" (and various other projects).

### Features:

- An open world with its own lore and hand-crafted, detailed and diverse landscapes (desert, heathlands, forests, jungles, mountains and more)
- An unconventional story with psychological and philosophical undercurrents
