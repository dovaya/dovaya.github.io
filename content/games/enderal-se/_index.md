[Enderal: Forgotten Stories (Special Edition)](https://mod.pub/enderal-se/38-enderal-se) (abbreviated to **Enderal SE**) is the 64-Bit port of [Enderal](/games/enderal), a single-player fantasy RPG created by the German game studio [SureAI](https://sureai.net). The port was created by and is maintained by [Eddoursul](https://mod.pub/enderal-se/@Eddoursul). 

The base game of [Enderal](/games/enderal) was released in 2016 under the name "Enderal: The Shards of Order" (German: "Enderal: Die Trümmer der Ordnung"), and the DLC "Enderal: Forgotten Stories" followed in 2019. The game is set in its own universe, using [Skyrim](/games/skyrim)'s engine.

**Note**: To any German native speakers, **I highly recommend to play the game in German**. It is a master class in character and dialogue writing, and the voice actors are incredible. (I am sure that the English version is excellent as well, but I have only played the German one, since I am a German native speaker myself.)

## About Enderal SE

**(From the [Official Enderal SE Download Page](https://mod.pub/enderal-se/38-enderal-se))**

Enderal: Forgotten Stories is a total conversion for TES V: Skyrim: a game modification that is set in its own world with its own landscape, lore and story. It offers an immersive open world, all for the player to explore, overhauled skill systems and gameplay mechanics and a dark, psychological storyline with believable characters.

Enderal is free and can be played by anyone owning a legal copy of TES V: Skyrim Special Edition. It was developed non-commercially by SureAI, the team behind the renowned Oblivion mod Nehrim: At Fate’s Edge (and various other projects), and later independently converted and maintained on the Skyrim SE engine by Eddoursul with help from other community members, most notably gavrant and overdev. See Credits for the full list of contributors.

SureAI does NOT provide any support for this version. Please, report your issues with Enderal SE only here or on our Discord. This page contains the core of the game, installable as a Skyrim SE mod, its requirements must be installed manually like with any other mod. This mod is also a base for Enderal VR, maintained by sasa2727, and for the SureAI published releases on Steam and GOG (discontinued in 2022).
