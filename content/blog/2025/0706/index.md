The new tool [Hair Texture Creator](/tools/hair-texture-creator) is out and available on [{{< svg "github-svgrepo-com" >}} GitHub](https://github.com/dovaya/hair-texture-creator)!

The origins of the tool go back to 2022, when I wrote the original [Python](/technologies/python) scripts for [GIMP](/technologies/gimp) 2.10 to create [Salt and Wind - KS Hairdos - Update](/mods/salt-and-wind). These scripts are available on the tool page as a legacy download.

The tool itself is comprised of a new [Python](/technologies/python) plugin based on the original scripts that is compatible with [GIMP](/technologies/gimp) 3.0. I will issue updates to this new version in case I need additional features to streamline the work with hair textures.

If you are interested in further updates, check in here from time to time and track the project on [{{< svg "github-svgrepo-com" >}} GitHub](https://github.com/dovaya/hair-texture-creator).
