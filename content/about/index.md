An avid fan of [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](/games/skyrim) since 2015 and [Enderal: Forgotten Stories](/games/enderal) since the release of the base game in 2016, I started creating mods in 2018. My main creative goal was, and has been to this day, extending game functionalities and improving assets to enhance the vanilla experience. I started with simple armour replacer mods that are compatible with both games, and these first mods have solidified my modding approach: improving what is already there, ensuring compatibility at all times.

Even though my main modding focus has always been on [Enderal SE](/games/enderal) and [Enderal](/games/enderal), since they use [Skyrim AE](/games/skyrim-ae)'s/[Skyrim SE](/games/skyrim-se)'s and [Skyrim](/games/skyrim)'s engines respectively, most of my mods end up being compatible with both games. I always make an effort to ensure that my mods function well for each game.

I am an official contributor to [Enderal SE](/games/enderal-se). My bugfixing mod [Head Mesh Fixes](/mods/head-mesh-fixes) was incorporated into patch version 2.0.12.

My biggest personal mod project to date is my head mesh overhaul series, consisting of [Freyja](/mods/freyja), [Freyr](/mods/freyr) and the upcoming [Njord](/mods/njord) mods. The first ones, released in 2021 and 2022 respectively, have taken me two years to develop, all while working part-time and pursuing a university degree. The last mod is still in development, as I had to take a break from modding in 2023 due to real-life responsibilities.

As of June 2025, I am officially back to modding, and I am very excited about continuing my work and diving into new projects.

### Workflow

I am a self-taught modeller in Blender, and I use various other tools in my mod creation pipeline. Establishing a good and efficient mod creation workflow is one of the most challenging things about modding. The tools and programs that I use for my mods can be found in the [Technologies](/technologies). My workflow resources, tools and Blender plugins can be found in the [Tools](/tools).

## Real life

In real life, I have a degree in Computer Science, and I work in research in academia. I am a native German speaker.
