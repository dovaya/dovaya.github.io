Welcome! I am **{{< span class="font-variant_small-caps" >}}Dovaya{{< /span >}}**, a computer scientist, visual artist and modder for [Enderal: Forgotten Stories](/games/enderal) and [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](/games/skyrim).

This is my personal website that I use to showcase my mods, tools and any other resources I develop when modding. You'll find details about all of these projects and any additional knowledge that I have gathered in relation to modding in the [Mods](/mods), [Tools](/tools) and [Articles](/articles) sections. You'll find mod updates, information about upcoming releases and other annoucements in the [Blog](/blog) section. For more information about me, check the [About](/about) section.

If you'd like to contact me, please do so (preferably) via NexusMods.
