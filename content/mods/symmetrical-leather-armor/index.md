## {{< svg "compass-svgrepo-com" >}} Introduction

_**Symmetrical Leather Armour**_ replaces the female leather armour mesh with a new one that has symmetrical pauldrons, either with or without extruded parts.

## {{< svg "list-svgrepo-com" >}} Features

There are two main versions: one with two even pauldrons and one with two extruded pauldrons. Each of these versions comes with a version with and one without underwear.

**Note**: This mod only replaces the *female* mesh. The male mesh and the ground object (the object that appears in your inventory) will stay the same. This means that all male characters and NPCs as well as the armour that shows up in your inventory will still have the asymmetrical armour mesh.

## {{< svg "zap-svgrepo-com" >}} Compatibility

Compatible with everything that does not alter the female leather armour mesh, including textures replacers.

## {{< svg "settings-svgrepo-com" >}} Installation

Use your favourite mod manager or install manually.

{{< spoiler title="Will you make a male version of this?" type="markdown" >}}
Most probably not. The male mesh is much trickier to alter than the female one , and I don't have the time nor the interest to create a male version.

{{< spoiler title="Will you make a modified ground object?" type="markdown" >}}
Most probably not. Again, the ground object mesh is trickier to handle than the female one, and I don't really care that it doesn't line up with the presentation of the female one. Not enough time and interest.
{{< /spoiler>}}

{{< spoiler title="Will you create a version for a different body replacer like CBBE?" type="markdown" >}}
Most probably not. I personally use the UNP body (with underwear) and I am perfectly happy with it. Though if there's a huge demand, I'll consider it.

{{< spoiler title="What is the difference between the armour with underwear and the one without?" type="markdown" >}}
There isn't a big difference, except for when you're sneaking. If you choose the armour with underwear, go into sneaking mode and try to look up your character's 'skirt', you will see underwear. If you choose the version without underwear, you will see her nude. That is the only difference, you'll normally not even notice it. If you're unsure about which one you should download, download the one with underwear.

{{< spoiler title="Can I use your model for my own mods?" type="markdown" >}}
Please ask for my permission first, I'll most likely give it to you.

{{< spoiler title="You know that the extruded part on the pauldron serves a purpose, right? This mod is not realistic!" type="markdown" >}}
Yes, I am aware that the extruded part of the pauldron is there to protect the wearer from blows to the neck. I have been before I made this mod. However, I don't care. So please stop bugging me about it.

{{< spoiler title="What textures are you using for the armour in the screenshots?" type="markdown" >}}
I use the textures from the Oldrim mod "aMidianBorn Book of Silence".
