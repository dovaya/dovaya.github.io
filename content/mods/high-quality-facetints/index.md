## {{< svg "compass-svgrepo-com" >}} Introduction

_**High Quality FaceTints**_ replaces all NPC FaceTints with high-quality ones, optionally with or without make-up, face discolouration and dirt. All textures are 1024x1024px and use mipmaps. They are compressed using BC1 compression.

## {{< svg "list-svgrepo-com" >}} Features

The original NPC FaceTints are 256x256px and were created using the original low-resolution Skyrim tint masks. This results in blocky and smudged face appearances.

The new ones are 1024x1024px (16x times larger) and were created using high-quality tint mask replacers found here on the Nexus. They are optimised and use mipmaps as well as appropriate compression (BC1). This results in a relatively low file size (~683kb per file) while providing a razor-sharp look.

There are four versions to choose from:

1. **With make-up, with face discolouration, with dirt.** For people who want to keep it vanilla.

2. **Without make-up, with face discolouration, with dirt.** For people who don't want-make up, but want to keep natural face discolourations and grime.

3. **Without make-up, without face discolouration, with dirt.** For people who want to have even skin tones but keep the grime.

4. **Without make-up, without face discolouration, without dirt.** For people who want completely bare faces.

**Compatible with everything.**

## {{< svg "settings-svgrepo-com" >}} Installation

Use whichever mod manager you prefer or install manually. Let it overwrite everything if prompted.

I recommend that you install [Head Mesh Fixes](/mods/head-mesh-fixes) and [Rhalâta Tattoo Revisited](/mods/rhalata-tattoo-revisited) before this mod to get the best visuals and no inconsistencies.
