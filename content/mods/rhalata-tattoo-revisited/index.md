## {{< svg "compass-svgrepo-com" >}} Introduction

_**Rhalâta Tattoo Revisited**_ adds the Rhalâta tattoo as a tattoo option to the character creation menu, making it available to the player character. This allows the Rhalâta NPCs to use the standard face textures.

## {{< svg "list-svgrepo-com" >}} Features

The original Rhalâta tattoos are not standard tattoos like the ones you can select in the character creation menu. Rather, they are drawn directly on their own face textures, making them a skin option rather than a tattoo option. These skin options are assigned to the Rhalâta NPCs, which results in said NPCs not using the standard face textures. 

If you are a stifler for details like me, you don't like this. You want all NPCs to use the standard face textures so they will be affected by texture replacers. This is why I made this mod.

_**Rhalâta Tattoo Revisited**_ extracts the Rhalâta tattoos from the above mentioned face textures and converts them into their own tattoo options. As a result, it is possible to assign the standard face textures to NPCs and just add the tattoo on top. This means that all NPCs will be affected by whatever texture replacers you might be using.

Furthermore, it makes the Rhalâta tattoo accessible to the player character via the character creation menu, making it possible to create a character that sympathises with the Rhalâta and its teachings (for role-play reasons).

Both the male and the female tattoo are 2k textures (2048 x 2048 px).

## {{< svg "zap-svgrepo-com" >}} Compatibility

- Any mod that alters the NPCs that use the Rhalâta tattoo needs a compatibility patch. 
- Any mod that alters the playable races needs a compatibility patch.

If you're unsure if a certain mod needs a patch, load both mods up in [xEdit](/technologies/xedit) and check.

**Note**: If you are using a character overhaul mod like [Freyja](/mods/freyja) or [Freyr](/mods/freyr) that alters the appearance of the Rhalâta characters, you will need to re-export the FaceGenData from the [Creation Kit](/technologies/creation-kit) with the character overhaul mod as well as _**Rhalâta Tattoo Revisited**_  enabled.
