## {{< svg "list-svgrepo-com" >}} Features

_**Dreadlocks For Women**_ includes a new hair option with a female-specific dreadlocks mesh that is based off the male base game model. It uses the same textures as the male version.

You can choose whether the dreadlocks should be accessible to all human women or only to Redguards.

The hair is available via the character creation menu.

## {{< svg "zap-svgrepo-com" >}} Compatibility

**Compatible with everything.**
The ESP only has two records that add the new hair and hairline to the game.
To ensure maximum compatibility with other mods, no NPC record was altered, so no NPC is using the hair.
