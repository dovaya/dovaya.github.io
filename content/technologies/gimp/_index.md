[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) is an image editor and 2D asset creation tool. It features a [Python API](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#Gimp-3.0) that I have used to create scripts that automate texture creation. You can find these scripts bundled into the [Hair Texture Creator](/tools/hair-texture-creator).
