[PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) is a shell program developed by Microsoft for task automation and configuration management. As is typical for a shell, it provides a command-line interpreter for interactive use and a script interpreter for automation via a language defined for it.

I use it to automate certain parts of my mod creation process, namely starting processes autonomously.
