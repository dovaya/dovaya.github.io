[Autodesk 3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview) is a 3D modelling and animation software.

I use 3ds Max 2018, which is not available for download anymore. The reason why I use this version is because it is the last version that is supported by the [Nif Plugin for 3ds Max 2015-2018](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10015) that I need to edit and export NIF meshes.

I exclusively use 3ds Max to skin meshes to skeletons, using its native scripting language. All of the actual designing and modelling is done in [Blender](/technologies/blender).
