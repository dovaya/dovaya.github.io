[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a 3D modelling and animation software.

I started working with Blender 2.78 in 2018. I taught myself modelling, mostly relying on my background as a computer scientist and programmer, on reading the official documentation and watching the odd YouTube video. 

Over the years, I have created various Blender [Python](/technologies/python) plugins that have automated various steps in my mod creation pipeline and have overall made my modding projects possible. They can be found in the [Tools](/tools). 

I am currently using Blender 4.4.
