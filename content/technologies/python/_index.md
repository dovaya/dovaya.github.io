[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a high-level programming language that is used by various tools to provide access to the tools' functionalities and data via an API. This allows to programmatically control the tool and automatise various tasks.

I extensively utilise [Blender](/technologies/blender)'s Python API to automate various steps in my mod creation process. The Python scripts and plugins that I have written to this end can be found in the [Tools](/tools). 

Additionally, I have used [GIMP](/technologies/gimp)'s Python API to automatically create 2D assets. These scripts can also be found in the [Tools](/tools).
