[Papyrus](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Papyrus) is the scripting language used by the Creation Engine. The Creation Engine is the game engine used by [Skyrim SE](/games/skyrim-se), [Skyrim AE](/games/skyrim-ae),[Enderal SE](/games/enderal-se), [Skyrim](/games/skyrim) and [Enderal](/games/enderal). A lot of the game logic (especially quests) is encoded in this language.
